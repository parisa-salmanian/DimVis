# DimVis: Interpreting Visual Clusters in Dimensionality Reduction With Explainable Boosting Machine

DimVis, developed by the DataVis Group at Linnaeus University, is an advanced visualization tool aimed at interpreting complex data clusters derived from dimensionality reduction techniques. The tool leverages the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) for an in-depth understanding of data patterns and cluster formations. It enables users to interactively explore and manipulate data points and hyperparameters to unveil the underlying structure within high-dimensional datasets. The core objective of DimVis is to transform intricate data into clear, actionable insights, facilitating researchers and data analysts in making data-driven decisions. This project explores DimVis's capabilities and assesses its performance in providing accurate and comprehensive data interpretations.
